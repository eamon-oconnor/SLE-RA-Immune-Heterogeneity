# SLE-RA-Immune-Heterogeneity

Replication of methodologies used by Zhang, Yuntian and Lee, Tzong-Yi in "Revealing the Immune Heterogeneity between Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid Arthritis Based on Multi-Omics Data Analysis".

Analyzes expression of immune system signaling pathways in SLE and RA. Uses the R package "Cellchat" to generate figures describing the communication between immune system cells in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Specifically examines the migration inhibitory factor pathway and galectin-9 pathway.

Requires pre-processed scRNA-seq data to run. Raw data available from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, processed data available upon request (currently working on publishable pre-processing script).
